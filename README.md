# My portfolio
* This portfolio project was conducted to present my skills.
* It took me approximately one and a half month starting from 18th JAN till 5th MAR

# Skills
* NextJS
* TypeScript
* React
* PostgreSQL
* Prisma
* Docker

# How the project went
1. Design
* I designed my portfolio page with Figma. I did some research on how other pages were designed to make mine look somehow better.

2. Choosing Framework and Skills
* I wanted to choose React as it takes vast space in the field and there is much information of it.
* As well as the reason above, I acknowledge that I have experience of already developing a service with React. But the development was all with JavaScript, which then finally made me decide to push myself a little bit harder to the edge, that TypeScript will be my next language for the project.
* I also wanted to show all I have pouring my skills into the pool. Then I took a chance to use PostgreSQL, Prisma, and NextJS13(app directory).

3. Development
* Nothing much to say. I started coding.
* I had chosen GSAP ScrollTrigger library to activate scroll detection and animation and it showed bugs in mobile environment. I decided not to utilize the library for version 1.x.x. Another library will be applied to settle scroll animation in version 2.x.x.

4. Deploy
* This was such a pain in the butt. Oracle cloud environment did not build the project properly and eventually causing 404 errors and 500 errors all the time. I found out that the built directory tree structure was differrent from my personal labtop. I built on local machine and deployed successfully.
* Automation with "docker compose" was my goal. the first release was without the automation but soon will be automated.
